# 🎓 Student Management System (Java OOP)

A simple yet fully functional **Student Management System** built using **pure Java (OOP)**.
The project demonstrates strong understanding of:

* Object-Oriented Programming
* Classes & Objects
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Relationships between objects (Student → Enrollment → Course)
* Basic management operations (Add, List, Search)

This project was created as part of my journey to improve Java skills and build clean OOP architecture.
